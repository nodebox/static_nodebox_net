Are you crazy? Never betray your blanket, cat and new TV series - there is no reason to leave your place today.
Even the best glasses won’t help you see the aurora! Don’t waste your time, try another day.

To watch or not to watch? This time we leave the choice to you.
Chances are 50/50. Make a plan B for tonight in case you fail.
It can be your lucky day, take some tea and wait a bit.
Dress yourself warm and go for a pleasurable aurora hunt.
This night watch is very promising! Don’t forget your camera to take some nice shots.
Ready, steady, go! This could be the best night of your life.
